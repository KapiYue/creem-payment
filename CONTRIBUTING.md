Contributing

Welcome
Thank you for your interest in contributing to creem-payment! Contributions of all kinds are welcome — bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code changes. Please read this guide before submitting anything so that maintainers can review and merge your work efficiently.

Getting Started
Development prerequisites
Node.js 18+
pnpm 9+
A Supabase project (free tier is sufficient)
A Creem account with at least one test product
Git

Fork and clone
Environment setup
Copy .env.example to .env.local and fill in your Supabase and Creem credentials. Run pnpm db:migrate to apply the latest migrations.

Contribution Types
Bug Reports
Before opening an issue, please search existing issues to avoid duplicates. When filing a bug report, include:
A concise, descriptive title
Steps to reproduce the issue
Expected vs. actual behavior
Relevant environment information (OS, Node version, browser if applicable)
Any relevant error messages or stack traces

Feature Requests
Open a GitHub Issue with the label enhancement. Describe the problem your feature solves and provide a rough implementation sketch if possible. Feature requests are discussed with the maintainers before work begins to avoid duplicate effort.

Pull Requests
For anything beyond small typo fixes, open an issue first to discuss the change. This saves you time if the direction does not align with project goals.
Pull request checklist:
Branch naming: feat/<name>, fix/<name>, docs/<name>, chore/<name>
Code style: run pnpm lint before pushing; fix all warnings
TypeScript: all new code must be fully typed; avoid any
Schema changes: run pnpm db:generate to create a migration file and commit it alongside the schema change
Commit messages: follow Conventional Commits — e.g. feat: add subscription pause endpoint
PR description: explain what changed, why, and how to test it

Code Style Guidelines
TypeScript strict mode is enabled — avoid type assertions unless absolutely necessary
Prefer server-side data fetching in Server Components and Route Handlers over client-side fetch where possible
All Drizzle queries must go through lib/db/index.ts — do not create additional database clients
Creem API calls must go through lib/creem.ts — do not call the Creem API directly from components
Environment variables must be validated at the point of use with a non-null assertion or runtime check; never hardcode secrets
Use nanoid for generating IDs — do not use Math.random() or Date.now()

Testing Webhooks Locally
Use the Creem CLI or a tunnel tool such as ngrok to expose your local server:

Review Process
Maintainers aim to respond to new pull requests within five business days. Reviews may request changes; please address all comments and push new commits to the same branch — do not force-push after review has started. Once approved, a maintainer will squash-merge the pull request.

Releasing
Releases are managed by the core maintainers and follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Contributors do not need to bump version numbers; the maintainers handle this as part of the release workflow.
